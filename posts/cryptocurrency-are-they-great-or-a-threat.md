Cryptocurrencies have emerged in investing world as a revolutionary change and gained immense popularity because of their ability to soar or make one rich. 

<br/>

## Advantages of Cryptocurrency

<br/>

**Decentralization:** It acts as a major advantage in the case of cryptocurrencies. Decentralization helps the creators or developers who release the coins in the  market to own a certain percent of the coin thus having control over the trends of the coin and avoiding monopoly. 

<br/>

**Secure:** Cryptocurrencies are extremely secure  because the blockchain is created on difficult  
mathematical puzzles thus making it hard to decode  and hack into.

<br/><br/>

## Environmental effect of Crypto Mining
<br/>
Came to no one’s notice initially but cryptocurrencies like  bitcoin consume a lot of electricity thus indirectly affecting  nature. Bitcoin especially consumes about 91 terawatt hours of electricity annually which rounds about to half a  percent of electricity consumed in the world and has been  increasing day by day. 

<br/><br/>

## Viable Solutions
<br/> 
There seem to exist “altcoins”, which are less lethal to  the environment. They differentiate from traditional  coins based on the process or technology of creation. Also, they differ by the process of the entire transaction. 

**Bitcoin** uses “proof of work” protocol which is power exhausting, while “altcoins” like **Ethereum** use “proof  of stake” protocol which takes into account the  environmental effects. 

Scientists are working on methods to reduce the  power consumption to mine cryptocurrencies.  Scientists from **3M** have been able to devise cooling technologies for data centers.
